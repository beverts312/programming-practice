# Multiples of 3 and 5  
Source: [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)  
Description: If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.  

## Typescript  
For my first go at it I used typescript, I was able to come up with a crude solution quickly.  
Maybe someday I will come back and write something more elegant or in another language.  
Check it out [here](./node/src/main.ts).  
To run (assumes you arleady have node/npm):  
1. Navigate to the `node` directory  
2. Install dev dependencies `npm install`  
3. Transpile: `npm run build`  
4. Execute: `npm run start`
